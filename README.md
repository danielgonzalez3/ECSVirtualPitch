Our Medical ML Library allows doctors and nurses to better diagnose their patients using a combination of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to cross-reference Electronic Health Records databases. Being a Machine learning software, diagnostic accuracy will increase as more data enters the Medical ML Library. This clinical tool will not only reduce the chances of misdiagnoses, but will prevent excessive treatment and unnecessary testing caused by misdiagnosis. In addition, doctors and nurses will have more time for a personal interaction with their patients yielding a faster and healthier recovery period, simultaneously improving the effectiveness and reliability of this tool in the health industry.
